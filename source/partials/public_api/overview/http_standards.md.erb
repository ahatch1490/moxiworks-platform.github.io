## HTTP Standards

All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using [standard HTTP methods](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html): GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
[Standard HTTP Response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) are used to indicate success and error conditions.
