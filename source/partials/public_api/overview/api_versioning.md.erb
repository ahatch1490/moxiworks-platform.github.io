## API Versioning
Moxi Works API uses the Accept header to denote the version of the API to be used. 

If you are using a Moxi Works Platform library, this header will already be included with every request.

<aside class='warning'>By default, the current version of the API will be used when it is not set in the Accept header. If you are depending on a specific version of the Moxi Works Platform in your logic, make sure that the Accept header is configured to send the version of the API you need.</aside>


> **API Version Embedded In Accept Header**

 ```http
POST /api/[RESOURCE] HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=1
 ```

 ```ruby
 # to view the version of the API used with your version of  moxiworks_platform Ruby library

MoxiworksPlatform::Resource.accept_header

 ```

 ```php
 <?php
 /* to view the version of the API used with your version of moxiworks_platform PHP library */

echo MoxiworksPlatform\Resource::accept_header

?>
 ```
