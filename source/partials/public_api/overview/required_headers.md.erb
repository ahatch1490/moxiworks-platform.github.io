### Required Headers

<aside class="note">If you are using a client access library to the Moxi Works Platform, required request headers will automatically be configured for you.</aside>


> **Required Headers Example**

```http
POST /api/[RESOURCE] HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic bpiYWFhYWFycnJycnJy==
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=1

```

```ruby
# required headers set automatically by moxiworks_platform library.
# to view, use the following:

MoxiworksPlatform::Resource.headers.inspect
```

```php
<?php
/* required headers seat automatically by moxiworks_platform library.
to view, use the following: 
*/
print_r(MoxiworksPlatform\Resource::headers());
?>
```

If you are implementing your own Moxi Works Platform library, you'll need to ensure that you have the following headers configured in your request:

     |     |    |
-----|-----|-----|
*Authorization*     | Used for platform authorization |`Basic [base64 encoded platform id and secret]`
*Accept*  | Used for API version and resource routing | `application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=1`
*Content-Type* | Used for handling data in request | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
