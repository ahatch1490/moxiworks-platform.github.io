## Required Headers

<aside class="note">If you are using a client access library to the Moxi Works Platform, required request headers will automatically be configured for you.</aside>


> **Example Headers Needed**

```apires
Authorization: Basic bpiYWFhYWFycnJycnJy==

Accept: application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

```



If you are implementing your own Moxi Works Platform library, you'll need to ensure that you have the following headers configured in your request:

     |     |    |
-----|-----|-----|
*Authorization*     | Used for platform authorization |`Basic [base64 encoded platform id and secret]`
*Accept*  | Used for API version and resource routing | `application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=1`
*Content-Type* | Used for handling data in request | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
