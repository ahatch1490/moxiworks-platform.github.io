<p>Moxi Works api allows partner access to Moxi Works Products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:  See examples here for information on accessing resources using various languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Base URL</strong>:  https://api.moxiworks.com/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Moxi Works API provides programmatic access to Moxi Works features and data. 
We do our best to adhere to open and accepted common standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and OAuth2 for Authentication and Authorization. </p>

<h2 id="client-libraries">Client Libraries</h2>

<p>The following libraries are available to help your integration process with the Moxi Works Platform public API:</p>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1">#Install the moxiworks_platform Ruby library to quickly integrate with the Moxi Works Platform.</span>

<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">moxiworks_platform</span>
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>

<p>Ruby client libraries for Moxi Works Platform can be from rubygems.org installed using gem.
<ul>
<li><a href='http://www.rubydoc.info/github/moxiworks-platform/moxiworks-ruby'>Documentation</a></li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/moxiworks-platform/moxiworks-ruby'>Source</a></li>
</ul></p>

<h2 id="restful-architecture">RESTful Architecture</h2>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Resources:

/contacts
/events
/tasks
</code></pre>

<p>The response payload is JSON encoded object(s) with defined structure which relfects a data model.</p>

<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Moxi Works API is user-generated content. Ensure that the response payload content is consumed safely to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your application.</aside>

<p>URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of contacts, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts</code>. 
This will return a list of Contact objects, where each Contact will have an &ldquo;id&rdquo; attribute. 
To get details on a particular contact, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/123456</code>, where 123456 is the &ldquo;id&rdquo; of the Contact you want. 
Similarly, to create a Contact, <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> a Contact object to <code class="prettyprint">https://api.moxiworks.com/contacts/</code>.</p>

<h2 id="http-standards">HTTP Standards</h2>

<p>All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">standard HTTP methods</a>: GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">Standard HTTP Response codes</a> are used to indicate success and error conditions.</p>

<h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#Example Authorization Header:</span>
<span class="c">#(note that the authorization header platform identifier and platform key are base64 encoded)</span>

Authorization: Basic <span class="nv">Zm9vb29vb29vb29vbzpiYWFhYWFycnJycnJy</span><span class="o">==</span>
</code></pre>

<pre class="highlight ruby"><code>

</code></pre>

<p><aside class="warning">To ensure that your key and secret remain secret, always use HTTPS when making requests from the Moxi Works Platform public API.</aside></p>

<p>The Moxi Works API utilizes Authorization HTTP headers for authorization. </p>

<p>To authorize your request, use the API Identifier and Secret combination you have been provided by your Moxi Works Platform representative.</p>

<p>When composing your basic header, per <a href='https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt'>RFC 2617</a> you&rsquo;ll need to base 64 encode your Moxi Works Platform Identifier and Secret and remember to separate your platform identifier and secret with a colon.</p>

<aside class='note'>You can acquire your Moxi Works API Identifier and Secret pair by contacting Moxi Works.</aside>

<p><aside class="warning">Do not include your Moxi Works API Identifier or Secret  in the parameters sent to the server; they must be set in the request header. Setting the API Identifier and Secret in the request parameters will result in an authorization failure.</aside></p>

<h2 id="data-security">Data Security</h2>

<p>The Moxi Works Platform public API requires all requests use HTTPS. Any response to the Moxi Works Platform API using HTTP will be rejected with a 403 (forbidden) error.</p>

<h2 id="input-output-format">Input / Output Format</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, and the response body data is returned as JSON.</p>

<h2 id="example-requests-amp-responses">Example Requests &amp; Responses</h2>

<p>For every API operation in this documentation, we show example requests and an example (JSON) response. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see the examples displayed in the grey panel to the right of each operation. </p>

<p>To view the sample code in a specific language, select the corresponding language tab at the top of the panel to the right. 
For more information about using the sample code in this API documentation, see <a href="#client-libraries">Client Libraries</a>. </p>

<p>As with any REST API, you can also test API requests / responses using a Chrome extension like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/">Advanced REST Client</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">POSTMAN</a>. </p>

<h2 id="versioning-and-changes">Versioning and Changes</h2>

<p><strong>Non-breaking changes</strong>: New features, functionality and bug fixes will be added to the API over time;
you should expect to see new endpoints or new attributes in the payload for existing endpoints. 
Non-breaking changes will not result in a new API version.  Ensure that your API consumer logic can handle new attributes gracefully. 
Ensure your API consumer logic does not depend on the order in which records are returned, unless static order is explicitly denoted in this documentation. </p>

<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong>: Although we intend to support and maintain the current version of the API indefinitely,
if changes that break the current API are made, we will publish the api update with a new version number, in order to ensure that the existing API functionality remains available to API consumers relying on that version. When breaking changes are added, the current version of the API will continue to be available.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecations</strong>: Moxi Works occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated; however, they may be removed entirely from a future version of the API as required. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. </p>

<h2 id="api-versioning">API Versioning</h2>

<p>Moxi Works API uses the Accept header to denote the version of the API to be used. By default, the current version of the API will be used when it is not set.</p>

<pre class="highlight shell"><code> Accept: application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version<span class="o">=</span>1
</code></pre>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Accept</em></td>
<td>The Moxi Works API uses the Accept header to denote the API version to be used ( <code class="prettyprint">application/vnd.moxi-platform+json;version=[VERSION NUMBER]</code>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">To ensure that your request to the Moxi Works API continue to function when breaking changes are introduced to the API, ensure that you use request header versioning  when accessing the Moxi Works API. If the API version is not denoted in the request header</aside>

<h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2>

<p>To ensure that system resources are not overloaded and response quality degrated, Moxi Works allows only a limited number of requests every minute. </p>

<p><strong>Handling &ldquo;Rate Limit Exceeded&rdquo; error</strong>
In order to prevent abuse and undue stress on the Moxi Works servers, the API has a rate limiting feature that restricts users to <strong>300</strong> requests per minute per Access Token. </p>

<p>If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit will be rejected with an <strong>429</strong> HTTP status code, along with the JSON response body shown to the right</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over-limit Error Response</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"errorCode"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">4000</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nt">"message"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Rate limit exceeded."</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>It is recommended that you design your integration to gracefully handle this rate limit error. 
One way to accomplish this would be to have your integration <em>sleep</em> for 60 seconds when this error is returned from the API, then retry the request. 
Alternatively, you might choose to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a> (an error handling strategy whereby you periodically retry a failed request with progressively longer wait times between retries, until either the request succeeds or a specified number of retry attempts is reached). </p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>

<p>The following table specifies the recommended action for each Moxi Works API error code. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use this table to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:</strong> <br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request. <br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.<br><br> &bull; If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.</p>
