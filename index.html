<p>Moxi Works api allows partner access to Moxi Works Products.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:  See examples here for information on accessing resources using various languages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Base URL</strong>:  https://api.moxiworks.com/v1/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Moxi Works API provides programmatic access to Moxi Works features and data. 
We do our best to adhere to open and accepted common standards, including REST for access, JSON format for the data, and OAuth2 for Authentication and Authorization. </p>

<h2 id="restful-architecture">RESTful Architecture</h2>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Resources:

/contacts
/events
/tasks
</code></pre>

<p>The response payload is JSON encoded object(s) with defined structure which relfects a data model.</p>

<p>URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions. For example, to get a list of contacts, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.moxiworks.com/v1/contacts</code>. 
This will return a list of Contact objects, where each Contact will have an &ldquo;id&rdquo; attribute. 
To get details on a particular contact, use <code class="prettyprint">GET https://api.moxiworks.com/v1/contacts/123456</code>, where 123456 is the &ldquo;id&rdquo; of the Contact you want. 
Similarly, to create a Contact, <code class="prettyprint">POST</code> a Contact object to <code class="prettyprint">https://api.moxiworks.com/v1/contacts/</code>.</p>

<h2 id="http-standards">HTTP Standards</h2>

<p>All actions taken through the API are done via HTTP using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">standard HTTP methods</a>: GET (to retrieve an object), POST (to create), PUT (to modify), and DELETE. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">Standard HTTP Response codes</a> are used to indicate success and error conditions.</p>

<h2 id="input-output-format">Input / Output Format</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, and the response body data is returned as JSON.</p>

<p>The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation and endpoint being invoked:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>Content-Type</em></td>
<td>For POST and PUT requests, must be set to the appropriate value (typically <code class="prettyprint">application/json</code>).  Ignored for GET and DELETE requests.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Accept</em></td>
<td>Optional; if not specified, <code class="prettyprint">*/*</code> is assumed (i.e. any response type is accepted), else it must match the output of the invoked endpoint (typically <code class="prettyprint">application/json</code>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<aside class="notice">Some of the data returned by the Moxi Works API is user-generated content. Ensure that the response payload content is consumed safely to avoid introducing vulnerabilities in your application.</aside>

<h2 id="example-requests-amp-responses">Example Requests &amp; Responses</h2>

<p>For every API operation in this documentation, we show example requests and an example (JSON) response. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll see the examples displayed in the dark blue panel next to each operation. </p>

<p>To view the sample code in a specific language, select the corresponding language tab along the top of the dark blue panel. 
For more information about using the sample code in this API documentation, see <a href="#sdks-and-sample-code">SDKs and Sample Code</a>. </p>

<p>As with any REST API, you can also test API requests / responses using a Chrome extension like <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo/">Advanced REST Client</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm">POSTMAN</a>. </p>

<h2 id="versioning-and-changes">Versioning and Changes</h2>

<p><strong>Non-breaking changes</strong>: New features, functionality and bug fixes will be added to the API over time;
you should expect to see new endpoints or new attributes in the payload for existing endpoints. 
Non-breaking changes will not result in a new API version.  Ensure that your API consumer logic can handle new attributes gracefully. 
Ensure your API consumer logic does not depend on the order in which records are returned, unless static order is explicitly denoted in this documentation. </p>

<p><strong>Breaking changes</strong>: Although we intend to support and maintain the current version of the API indefinitely,
if changes that break the current API are made, we will publish the api update with a new version number, in order to ensure that the existing API functionality remains available to API consumers relying on that version. When breaking changes are added, the current version of the API will continue to be available.</p>

<p><strong>Deprecations</strong>: Moxi Works occasionally deprecates APIs to indicate that those APIs should no longer be used in active development. 
Deprecated APIs typically remain present and usable for a reasonable period of time following the release in which they were deprecated; however, they may be removed entirely from a future version of the API as required. 
You should never use deprecated APIs in new development, and if you have existing code that uses deprecated APIs, we recommend that you update that code as soon as possible. </p>



<h1 id="api-usage">API Usage</h1>

<h2 id="rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</h2>

<p>To ensure that system resources are not overloaded and response quality degrated, Moxi Works allows only a limited number of requests every minute. </p>

<p><strong>Handling &ldquo;Rate Limit Exceeded&rdquo; error</strong>
In order to prevent abuse and undue stress on the Moxi Works servers, the API has a rate limiting feature that restricts users to <strong>300</strong> requests per minute per Access Token. </p>

<p>If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit will be rejected with an <strong>429</strong> HTTP status code, along with the JSON response body shown to the right</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>{
  "errorCode": 4000,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded."
}
</code></pre>

<p>It is recommended that you design your integration to gracefully handle this rate limit error. 
One way to accomplish this would be to have your integration <em>sleep</em> for 60 seconds when this error is returned from the API, then retry the request. 
Alternatively, you might choose to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff">exponential backoff</a> (an error handling strategy whereby you periodically retry a failed request with progressively longer wait times between retries, until either the request succeeds or a specified number of retry attempts is reached). </p>

<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>

<p>The following table specifies the recommended action for each Moxi Works API error code. </p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Use this table to implement error handling logic according to the following guidelines:

* If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.
* If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request until the problem has been fixed.
* If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.

<!--

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'moxiworks-platform'

api = MoxiWorksPlatform::APIClient.authorize!('myApiKey')
```

```python
import moxiworks-platform

api = kittn.authorize('myApiKey')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: myApiKey"
```

> Make sure to replace `myApiKey` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Isis",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves all kittens.

### HTTP Request

`GET http://example.com/api/kittens`

### Query Parameters

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
include_cats | false | If set to true, the result will also include cats.
available | true | If set to false, the result will include kittens that have already been adopted.

<aside class="success">
Remember — a happy kitten is an authenticated kitten!
</aside>

## Get a Specific Kitten

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get(2)
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens/2"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Isis",
  "breed": "unknown",
  "fluffiness": 5,
  "cuteness": 10
}
```

This endpoint retrieves a specific kitten.

<aside class="warning">If you're not using an administrator API key, note that some kittens will return 403 Forbidden if they are hidden for admins only.</aside>

### HTTP Request

`GET http://example.com/kittens/<ID>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
ID | The ID of the kitten to retrieve
